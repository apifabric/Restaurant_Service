Use SQLAlchemy to create a sqlite database named system/genai/temp/model.sqlite  .

The purpose of the database is: User Service: Handles user authentication, profile management, and user preferences.
Restaurant Service: Manages restaurant listings, details, and availability.
Menu Service: Manages menu items, pricing, and availability for each restaurant.
Order Service: Handles order creation, tracking, and history.
Payment Service: Manages payment processing, transaction history, and refunds.
Notification Service: Sends notifications to users and restaurants about order status, promotions, and updates.
Delivery Service: Manages delivery logistics, driver assignments, and tracking.
Review Service: Handles user reviews and ratings for restaurants and delivery experiences.

Create at least 12 tables.

Hints: use autonum keys, allow nulls, foreign keys, no check constraints.
If you choose to use a date, only use python datetime datatype.
Remember that SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input, this means you can not enter string attributes where a date or datetime object is expected.Provide a short description of each table. Include the description in each data model class docstring, prefixed with 'description: '. 
Don't use python DECIMAL type.
Don't install additional packages.
Don't use the faker pip package.

Create at least 48 rows of sample data. Add at least one row per table. Add some relationships and use foreign key columns instead of relationship names for the data inserts.
